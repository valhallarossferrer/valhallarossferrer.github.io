In ketosis, your body burns ketones (instead of glucose) for fuel, which provides numerous physiological benefits for your body."},{information:"Why would you want to eat fat instead of carbs? When you eat high amounts of carbohydrates, these convert into glucose in the liver[*]. This causes your body to produce insulin (commonly referred to as an insulin spike, leading to insulin resistance), to help transport glucose through your bloodstream."},{information:"Glucose will always be your body’s preferred energy source. When glucose is present, your body will resist burning fat. By removing carbohydrates and replacing them with fat, you are forcing your body to burn that fat for fuel."}]},{name:"Ketogenic Diet Macronutrients",img:"assets/imgs/macros.png",children:[{name:"Fat Intake",children:[{information:"Fat is the cornerstone of the keto diet, making up the bulk of calories. An individual consuming 2,000 calories per day would need to consume 144 to 177 grams of fat. Fats make up 70-80% of your calories. Since fat is the main source of nutrition on a ketogenic diet, it’s important to source high-quality, healthy fats, which you’ll read about below."}]},{name:"Protein Intake",children:[{information:"Protein is extremely important on keto as well.

The Standard Ketogenic Diet (SDK): The most common approach to keto, here 75% of your diet comes from fats, 20% from protein and 5% from carbohydrate."},{information:"2. The Targeted Ketogenic Diet (TKD): Used by athletes seeking a performance boost who are not as interested in fat loss. This is where you eat 20 to 50 grams of net carbs per day. Carb intake usually happens prior to exercise."},{information:"3. The Cyclical Ketogenic Diet (CKD): This diet is preferred by those who find it mentally challenging to completely forgo carbs for extended periods of time. Here, you follow SKD for a certain time period, followed by a period of eating more carbohydrates."},{information:"4. The High-Protein Ketogenic Diet: Designed for anyone lifting heavy and seeking to gain lean mass, the macros here follow 60% fats, 35% protein and 5% carbs."},{information:"If you are just starting keto, you might consider starting with the Standard Ketogenic Diet approach."}]},{name:"What to Eat on Keto: Ketogenic Food List",children:[{information:"When starting keto, you may need to replenish the foods in your fridge or pantry.
